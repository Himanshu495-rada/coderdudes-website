            <p>In this quick tutorial we are going to learn how to make telegram bot python programming to automate our daily tasks. Also known as OCR bot. All explaination is provided in video please check out above video for better understanding.</p>

            <h2 className="my-3">What is Telegram Bot ?</h2>
            <p>Telegram bots are small programs that can embed in Telegram chats or public channels and perform a specific function. They can offer customized keyboards, produce cat memes on demand, or even accept payments and act as a digital storefront. Bots are popular on Telegram, because they're fun and convenient, and Telegram has supported them since 2015. They are essentially automated Telegram accounts; you can just add them to chats and channels as you would a friend. But while researching the bot platform, Forcepoint realized that the feature doesn't incorporate the encryption algorithm Telegram uses to protect its chats. As a result, adding a bot to a chat or channel undermines its security, potentially making it easier for a third party to intercept messages.</p>
